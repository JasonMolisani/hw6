                        Origami started as the Japanese art of paper folding. Traditional origami uses a single square
                        piece of paper to produce a model. As time has passed, origami has grown to include many forms
                        and has spread across the world.

                        This website focuses specifically on unit origami. Unit origami, also called modular origami,
                        is a style of origami where multiple pieces of paper are folded in to separate units/modules
                        that are joined together to create the final model. For some types of unit origami, these units
                        will be different.
                    </p>

                        The variant of unit origami that this website deals with can also be referred to as 3D origami
                        or Golden Venture Folding. It is built around making a number of trianglular units and
                        assembling them into the finished model. All triangle units are made the same way. The only
                        differences between units will be caused by differences in the size and color of the paper the
                        unit is made from.
                    </p>

                        As traditional origami uses just paper, this website will avoid designs that necessitate
                        non-paper materials. The only minor exception is the use of glue to reinforce the points where
                        individual units are joined together. The paper and shapes made should convey what the model is
                        on its own.
                    </p>

                        That said, there is nothing wrong with adding googly-eyes and a hat to your model. This is an
                        art form. Do whatever you want to express yourself.
