                        Origami started as the Japanese art of paper folding. Traditional origami uses a single square
                        piece of paper to produce a model. As time has passed, origami has grown to include many forms
                        and has spread across the world.

                        This website focuses specifically on unit origami. Unit origami, also called modular origami,
                        is a style of origami where multiple pieces of paper are folded in to separate units/modules
                        that are joined together to create the final model. Sometimes, these units will be different.
                        The triangle units used in this website will all be made the same way. The only differences
                        between units will be caused by differences in the size and color of the paper the unit is made
                        from.
